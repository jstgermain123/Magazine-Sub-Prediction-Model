# Magazine-Sub-Prediction-Model
 Understanding Magazine Subscription Behavior using logistic regression and SVM. Completed for a class on predictive analytics.The goal of this project is to assist a magazine company identify potential reasons why they experienced a decline in magazine subscriptions during the past year.  To achieve this goal, we created a logistic regression model to help identify what features of the dataset tend to influence subscriptions. The first step in our process was to clean our dataset and ensure that our data was the highest quality possible. After cleaning our data, we then ran a logistic regression model which included all variables. These results were used as a baseline to determine if our future optimization techniques were effective. After running the baseline model, we ran two additional models including a stepwise logistic regression model and a SVM model. These optimized models were then compared to each other to identify which model was the most accurate. The resulting model was then used to inform decisions around what factors influenced subscriptions the most.
